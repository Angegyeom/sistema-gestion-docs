/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for OptimoSystem.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access and restricts write access to authenticated users.
 * Since there's no user ownership, all data is stored in root-level collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data resides in top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}
 * - /documentos/{docId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users only.
 * - User data in /users/{userId} is only accessible by the owner.
 * - Document data in /documentos/{docId} can be read and created by any authenticated user.
