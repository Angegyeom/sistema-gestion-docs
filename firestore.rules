/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for OptimoSystem.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access and restricts write access to authenticated users.
 * Since there's no user ownership, all data is stored in root-level collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data resides in top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users only.
 * - User data in /users/{userId} is only accessible by the owner.

     * @allow (create) - Any authenticated user can create their own user profile document.
     * @deny (list, delete) - No one can list all users or delete a user profile.
     * @principle Enforces user data privacy and ownership.
